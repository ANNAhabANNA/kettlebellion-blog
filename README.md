-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Code Insititue red, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Bugs

-   During the early deployment an error occurred in the application and the webpage could not be served. The application logs showed error code H10. 
    - This was solved by correcting a typing error in Heroku app name (ketllebelllion instead of ketllebellion).
    - Further debugging also revealed wrong folder name in Procfile (kettlebellion-blog instead of kettlebellion).
    - During the debugging DEBUG flag was changed to False caused by confusion, but changed to True again until the day of the production deployment.

-   When creating my first view the website pages did not render and TemplateDoesNotExist at/ error was showing.
    - This was solved by fixing the path in setting.py by changing  TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates') to TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates/blog').
-   CSS file did not render for django-allauth login.html which was solved by installing ```pip install django-bootstrap5```.

## Deployment

This project was developed using [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/ "GitPod") - an open-source developer platform. The code was tracked by [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git") - open-source distributed version control system, and hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/ "Link to GitHub") - code hosting platfrom for version control and collaboration. 

### Deploying on Heroku
To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1. Create Heroku App:
    - Click "New" tab in the dashboard and choose "Create new app" from dropdown menu.
    - Type your app name and select the location.

2. Attach the PostgreSQL database, Cloudinary API and PORT 8000 for improved compatibility with various Python libraries:
    - Click "Resources" tab in the app dashboard menu and search for Heroku Postgres in the "Add-ons" bar.
    - Click "Settings" tab in the app dashboard menu, click "Reveal Config Vars" and copy the string value for DATABASE_URL key. Click "Add".
    - Type CLOUDINARY_URL in the next KEY field and paste the Cloudinary API Environment Variable in the VALUE field. Click "Add".
    - Type PORT in the next KEY field and 8000 in the VALUE field. Click "Add".

3. Prepare the environment and settings.py file in Gitpod:
    - Create an env.py file in the same directory where manage.py is located. 
    - In env.py add the DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY and CLOUDINARY_URL.
    ``` 
    import os
    os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = " _here paste the DATABASE_URL key that was copied in step 2_ "
    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = " _here create an unique secret key value and copy-paste this secret key value to Heroku "Config Vars" beneath DATABASE_URL created in step 2)_ "
    os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = " _here paste Cloudinary API Environment Variable provided after registration_ "
    ```
    - Reference env.py in settings.py, replace insecure key with the secret environment variable and  wire up Heroku Postgres database.
    ```
    import os
    import dj_database_url
    if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
        import env

    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
    
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
    ```
    - Link app to Cloudinary in settings.py by adding Cloudinary libraries to INSTALLED_APPS section and by directing Django to Cloudinary for media and static files storage.
    ```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'cloudinary_storage',
        'cloudinary',
    ]

    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
    ```
    - Direct Django to to templates location in settings.py by adding in a templates directory beneath BASE_DIR and by changing ```'DIRS': []``` to ```'DIRS':[TEMPLATES_DIR]``` in TEMPLATES.

    ```
    TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')

    ```
    - Add Heroku app name to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py.
    ```
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['heroku_app_name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
    ```

4. Create three new directories (media, static, templates) and a new file Procfile next to manage.py in Gitpod.
    - Add 'web: gunicorn app_directory_name.wsgi' to Procfile.
5. Deploy the project on Heroku using GitHub as the deployment method.
    - Click "Deploy" tab in the app dashboard menu and click GitHub in "Deployment Method" section.
    - Type your GitHub repo name in the search bar and click "Connect".
    - Click "Deploy Branch" in "Manual Deploy" section and wait for the successful deployment message.
    - Click "Open app".
